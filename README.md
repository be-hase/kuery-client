## Introduction

### Features

- **Love SQL â™¥**
    - While ORM libraries in the world are convenient, they often require learning their own DSL, which I believe has a
      high learning cost. Kuery Client emphasizes writing SQL as it is.
- **Based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc**
    - Kuery Client is implemented based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc. Use whichever you prefer. You can use
      Spring's ecosystem as it is, such as `@Transactional`.
- **Observability**
    - It supports Micrometer Observation, so Metrics/Tracing/Logging can also be customized.
- **Extensible**
    - When dealing with complex data schemas, there are often cases where you want to write common query logic. Thanks
      to Kotlin's extension functions, this becomes easier.

### Motivation

I have used numerous ORM libraries, but in the end, I preferred libraries like MyBatis that allow writing SQL directly.

To construct SQL dynamically, custom template syntax (such as if/foreach) is often used, but I prefer to write logic
using the syntax provided by the programming language as much as possible.
I want to write dynamic SQL using Kotlin syntax, similar to [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html).

To meet these needs, I implemented Kuery Client.

### Overview

By using the following SQL builder, you can easily build and execute SQL. Whether using R2DBC or JDBC, the way of
writing is almost the same.

```kotlin
data class User(...)

class UserRepository(private val kueryClient: KueryClient) {
    suspend fun findById(userId: Int): User? = kueryClient
        .sql { +"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $userId" }
        .singleOrNull()

    suspend fun search(status: String, vip: Boolean?): List<User> = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"""
            SELECT * FROM users
            WHERE
            status = $status
            """
            if (vip != null) {
                +"vip = $vip"
            }
        }
        .list()

    suspend fun insertMany(users: List<User>): Long = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"INSERT INTO users (username, email)"
            // useful helper function
            values(users) { listOf(it.username, it.email) }
        }
        .rowsUpdated()
}
```

This SQL builder is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember:

- You can concatenate SQL strings using `+`(unaryPlus).
    - You can also directly express logic such as if statements in Kotlin.
- When you want to embed dynamic values, use string interpolation.
    - In kuery client, the behavior of string interpolation is modified using a Kotlin compiler plugin. When using
      string interpolation, it is expanded as a placeholder.

### Based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc

Currently, it is implemented based on the well-established `spring-data-r2dbc` and `spring-data-jdbc` in the Java
community. Kuery Client simply provides the aforementioned SQL builder on this foundation.

It is designed to be used alongside both `spring-data-r2dbc` and `spring-data-jdbc`, allowing you to start small.

In the future, we may add a different foundation or possibly create a new one from scratch.

## Getting Started

### Install

#### Gradle

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("dev.hsbrysk.kuery-client") version "{{version}}"
}

implementation("dev.hsbrysk.kuery-client:kuery-client-spring-data-r2dbc:{{version}}")
// or, implementation("dev.hsbrysk.kuery-client:kuery-client-spring-data-jdbc:{{version}}")
```

### Build KueryClient

#### for `kuery-client-spring-data-r2dbc`

```kotlin
val connectionFactory: ConnectionFactory = ...

val kueryClient = SpringR2dbcKueryClient.builder()
    .connectionFactory(connectionFactory)
    .build()
```

#### for `kuery-client-spring-data-jdbc`

```kotlin
val dataSource: DataSource = ...

val kueryClient = SpringJdbcKueryClient.builder()
    .dataSource(dataSource)
    .build()
```

### Let's Use It

```kotlin
val userId = "..."
val user: User = kueryClient
    .sql { +"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $userId" }
    .singleOrNull()
```

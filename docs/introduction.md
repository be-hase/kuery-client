# Introduction

## Features

- **Love SQL â™¥**
    - While ORM libraries in the world are convenient, they often require learning their own DSL, which We believe has a
      high learning cost. Kuery Client emphasizes writing SQL as it is.
- **Based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc**
    - Kuery Client is implemented based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc. Use whichever you prefer. You can use
      Spring's ecosystem as it is, such as `@Transactional`.
- **Observability**
    - It supports Micrometer Observation, so Metrics/Tracing/Logging can also be customized.
- **Extensible**
    - When dealing with complex data schemas, there are often cases where you want to write common query logic. Thanks
      to Kotlin's extension functions, this becomes easier.

## Motivation

We have used numerous ORM libraries, but in the end, we preferred libraries
like [MyBatis](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3) that allow writing SQL directly.

To construct SQL dynamically, custom template syntax (such as if/foreach) is often used, but we prefer to write logic
using the syntax provided by the programming language as much as possible.
We want to write dynamic SQL using Kotlin syntax, similar to [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html).

To meet these needs, we implemented `Kuery Client`.

## Overview

By using the following SQL builder, you can easily build and execute SQL. Whether using R2DBC or JDBC, the way of
writing is almost the same.

By providing a Kotlin compiler plugin, we achieve binding parameters using string interpolation.

```kotlin [kuery-client-spring-data-r2dbc]
data class User(...)

class UserRepository(private val kueryClient: KueryClient) {
    suspend fun findById(userId: Int): User? = kueryClient
        .sql { +"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $userId" }
        .singleOrNull()

    suspend fun search(status: String, vip: Boolean?): List<User> = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"""
            SELECT * FROM users
            WHERE
            status = $status
            """
            if (vip != null) {
                +"AND vip = $vip"
            }
        }
        .list()

    suspend fun insertMany(users: List<User>): Long = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"INSERT INTO users (username, email)"
            // useful helper function
            values(users) { listOf(it.username, it.email) }
        }
        .rowsUpdated()
}
```

```kotlin [kuery-client-spring-data-jdbc]
data class User(...)

class UserRepository(private val kueryClient: KueryBlockingClient) {
    fun findById(userId: Int): User? = kueryClient
        .sql { +"SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $userId" }
        .singleOrNull()

    fun search(status: String, vip: Boolean?): List<User> = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"""
            SELECT * FROM users
            WHERE
            status = $status
            """
            if (vip != null) {
                +"AND vip = $vip"
            }
        }
        .list()

    fun insertMany(users: List<User>): Long = kueryClient
        .sql {
            +"INSERT INTO users (username, email)"
            // useful helper function
            values(users) { listOf(it.username, it.email) }
        }
        .rowsUpdated()
}
```

:::

This SQL builder is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember:

- You can concatenate SQL strings using `+`(unaryPlus).
    - You can also directly express logic such as if statements in Kotlin.
- By using string interpolation, it is possible to bind parameters.

## Based on spring-data-r2dbc and spring-data-jdbc

Currently, it is implemented based on the well-established `spring-data-r2dbc` and `spring-data-jdbc` in the Java
community. Kuery Client simply provides the aforementioned SQL builder on this foundation.

It is designed to be used alongside both `spring-data-r2dbc` and `spring-data-jdbc`, allowing you to start small.

In the future, we may add a different foundation or possibly create a new one from scratch.
